<h1>News Today</h1>

Some text here. 
<br /><b>This is bold text.</b>
<br /> <strong>This is strong text. It is the same as bold.</strong>

<br /><i>This is italic text.</i>
<br /><em>This is "emphatic" text. It is the same as italic.</em>

<hr />

Horizontal line break here. <br /> Then a line break here.

<blockquote><em>
They say that life's a carousel <br />
Spinning fast, you've got to ride it well <br />
The world is full of Kings and Queens <br />
Who blind your eyes and steal your dreams <br />
It's Heaven and Hell  -- Ronnie James Dio
</em></blockquote>

Blockquote double-indents but it does not preserve linebreaks. Interesting.
