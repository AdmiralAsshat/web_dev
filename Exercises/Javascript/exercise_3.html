<!--Create a web page that asks the user to enter two numbers and display proper messages based on
whether those number are equal or not. If both numbers are equal, the displayed message should be
“<number1> and <number2> are equal”. Otherwise, the message should be either “<number1> is greater
than <number2>” or “<number1> is less than <number2>”. <number1> and <number2> should replace the
numbers entered by the user. -->
